## Project Description
CREATEFI is a comprehensive Substrate-based blockchain ecosystem with a professional React frontend. It features a **fixed gas fee system**, decentralized governance, stablecoin vaults, and a fully integrated decentralized exchange (DEX). The system is designed to provide predictable transaction costs, robust DeFi infrastructure, and an intuitive user experience.

## Motivation
Most DeFi blockchains today suffer from **highly volatile transaction fees**, creating friction for users and developers. CREATEFI solves this problem by implementing **fixed gas fees**, making DeFi operations more predictable and user-friendly. It combines multiple core DeFi components (token launchpad, stablecoins, DEX, DAO governance) into a single, cohesive ecosystem.

## Deliverables / Milestones

### Milestone 1 – Fee Engine & CREATE Token (Timeline: 2 months)
- Implement `pallet-fee-engine` for fixed gas fees
- Launch `CREATE` governance token
- Integrate staking and reward system
- **Expected Impact:** Enable predictable fees for first 1,000 users, ready for staking & governance testing

### Milestone 2 – FI Stablecoin System (Timeline: 2 months)
- Develop multi-asset collateralized stablecoin vaults (`pallet-fi-stablecoin`)
- Implement liquidation and interest mechanisms
- Provide vault management UI in frontend
- **Expected Impact:** Support $100k+ TVL in collateral, allow secure borrowing and lending operations

### Milestone 3 – Decentralized Exchange & DAO Governance (Timeline: 3 months)
- Build AMM-based DEX (`pallet-dex`) with multiple trading pairs
- Integrate DAO governance (`pallet-dao`) for proposal creation and voting
- Enable treasury tracking, voting, and automatic execution
- Complete frontend integration for all modules
- **Expected Impact:** Enable trading of $500k+ TVL, fully functional DAO for decentralized decision-making

## Funding Request
- Level 2 Grant: $30,000  
- 50% DOT (vested over 2 years), 50% USDC  
- Milestone-based payments: $10k per milestone

## Technical Details
- **Blockchain:** Substrate-based solo-chain  
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS  
- **Pallets:** fee-engine, create-token, fi-stablecoin, dex, dao  
- **Throughput:** 1000+ TPS  
- **Block Time:** 6 seconds, finality 12 seconds  
- **Open Source:** Apache 2.0 License

## Ecosystem Fit
CREATEFI enhances the Polkadot ecosystem by:  
- Providing a predictable-fee blockchain for DeFi applications  
- Offering a modular Substrate codebase for developers  
- Demonstrating a full-stack DeFi ecosystem with governance, stablecoins, and DEX capabilities  
- **Potential Ecosystem Impact:** Up to 10,000 active users within first 6 months, $500k+ TVL across all modules

## Team Experience
- Rust & Substrate blockchain development  
- React & TypeScript frontend engineering  
- Prior work: solo-chain prototypes, token launchpads, DeFi modules  

## Additional Notes
- All code is open-source and independent of closed-source software.  
- Milestones include full documentation, tutorials, and demo videos for adoption.  
- Focus is on software implementation; no token sale or investment promotion is included.
